GomTV.Net (XBMC Plugin)
=======================

XBMC Plugin to watch archived VOD's from m.gomtv.net.


Known Limitations
-----------------

*   Can't view live streams. This is because they aren't available on m.gomtv.net
*   It can be difficult to differentiate between Code A and Code S matches. Again this is due to m.gomtv.net not providing that information.
*   Login via SNS account (Facebook or Twitter) not available.


Requirements
------------

*   XBMC (tested with 10.1 "Dharma" for Windows and Linux)
*   GomTv.Net Login and Premium Season Ticket to watch more than the first game of each match.
*   Internet Connection ;)


Installation
------------

1. Download the ZIP file and save to a location accessible by XBMC.
2. Open XBMC and browse to System > Add-ons > Install from zip file.
3. Browse to the file you downloaded and select it.
